# Lotus Forge (MTG Deck Organizer)

Lotus Forge is a simple single page application that uses live crypto data from the open source API called Coingecko to allow users to view and track crypto coins. 

## Installation

Fork this repo, copy the SSH link, and type "git clone 'SSH link'" into your terminal in your desired directory.

## Usage

Lotus Forge is a single page application that allows a user to create an account and easily organize MTG cards into decks that you have created. Due to it's simplicity in adding and removing cards, it provides an effortless alternative to build out your decks digitally before spending money an dtime building the deck in real life. Besides that, it also allows you to conveniently have all your deck information in one place.

Users, with or without accounts, are able to look at everyone's decks that have been made on the home page. If you are not logged on, or are looking at somone's else's deck, you will not be able to modify that deck. This gives all users to be able to pull ideas and in a way collaborate with the community at large.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Roadmap

I plan on eventually adding the capability to show multiple cards when searching for new cards to add to your decks. 

Also I am planning on adding a search functionality that does not just rely on knowing the name of a card.
